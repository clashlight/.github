# ClashLight - Collective of Bible Based AI Builders

We stand as **mercenary technologists for God**—equipping Biblical organizations with AI.

> *“Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.”*  - Ephesians 5:11

> *“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”*  - John 1:5

## ⚡ What We Do
We are NOT an agency or consultancy. 

We are a collective of technology builders who equip and expand Bible based organizations with AI. 

- **AI Systems for God**  
  We design and deploy AI technology to scale reach, influence, and impact. 

- **Shared Source Community**  
  Within the collective, ALL projects shared source so our impact is exponential. 

- **Impactful, But Often SIMPLE**  
  We can often create impact in hours, with precise aim of our skills at problems we were are made aware of. 

The result of our work is AI technology amplifying and accelerating the movement of Bible based organizations in the world.

## 🌍 The Impetus
On September 10, 2025, **Charlie Kirk was assassinated** while creating space for debate and discussion.  

He warned:  
> “When people stop talking, that’s when you get violence. You think the other side is so evil, they lose their humanity. That's how civil war starts!"

Charlie Kirk was a man, imperfect in many ways. But his killing was a moment of awakening for those that follow God - darkness is winning, and we must do better.

## 🛡️ Our Ethos
We don’t just shine our light — **we CLASH with darkness**.

> “Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.” (Eph. 5:11)

We strive to be **brave and combative- but also redemptive**. 

We attack darkness, not the people overcome by it.

## 🧩 How We’re Structured
- **Core Team**  
  A small group coordinates projects, vets members, and support the growth of the collective. 

- **The Collective**  
  A distributed network of engineers, product builders, designers, and PMs—hand-picked for both technical skill and Biblical conviction. Think of us as **missionaries with AI skills**— or mercenaries against darkness.

- **Partner Organizations**  
  Ministries, Biblical institutions, Christian schools, non-profits, and companies that need would be more impactful with AI solutions.

## 💰 Financial Model
1. We scope projects with partner orgs.  
2. Collective members are assigned contractor-style, paid per project.  
3. ClashLight receives a margin for to help coordinate the project, and drive the mission. 

This creates a **flexible, sustainable talent engine** for kingdom-impacting AI.

> We are seeking alternative financial models to maximize impact for all organziations, regardless of budget. Contribute ideas.

## 📍 Why GitHub?
Our model maps perfectly onto open source community structures:
- Repos = individual projects (public & private)  
- Issues & PRs = task management and workflow  
- Discussions & Wikis = community, culture, and collaboration  

We’re modeling this off of open source movements, because we see MANY that want to contribute and collaborate.
