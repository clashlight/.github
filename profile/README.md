# ClashLight - Collective of Bible Based AI Builders

On September 10, 2025, **Charlie Kirk was assassinated** while creating space for debate and discussion.  

Charlie was a man, imperfect in ways. But he preached God's word. 

His death, and the approving and even celebratory responses that followed, were an awakening for all that know God... even if only from a distance.

**This moment reminds us that Evil is real. And it has a strong foothold to advance from.**

## What Does God Expect of Us, As Technology Builders?

God calls on those who know Him to stand against the schemes of the devil (~ Ephesians 6:11). 

- He blesses each of us with unique gifts. 
- He expects us to use our gifts to help all find him. 
- (~ Romans 12:6-8, ~  Ephesians 4:11-13).

As Builders of technology, we are blessed with the gift of leverage. We scale effort and can impact millions. 

This has always been true of technology, but do you see what is happening NOW?

- The use of AI increased exponentially the leverage we already had as builders. 
- AI has also lowered the barrier to building, which mulitplies the number of builders. 

God works in mysterious ways. AI's advancement, especially in the year leading up to Charlie Kirk's assassination, may not be a coincidence.

## What is ClashLight?

ClashLight is a collective of Bible Based AI builders. 

We equip Bible believing organizations with technology, as an armor of God and a weapon against evil. Our intent is to support their stand against the schemes of the devil in the world. (~ Ephesians 6:11).

We use technology to bring the clash of light to darkness. 

> *"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."*  - John 1:5

We are NOT an agency or consultancy. We are a collective: 

- **AI Technology Implementation** - We design and deploy technology to strengthen reach, deepen impact, and advance kingdom work. 

- **Shared Source Community** - Within the collective, ALL projects are "shared source" to accelerate our impact over time. 

- **Sometimes Simple** - Trivial solutions can have massive impact. We seek awareness of any and all problems to solve. 

The result is the strenghening and acceleration of organizations sharing God's work in the world.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Operating Principles 
- We don't just share God's light ‚Äî we equip others to clash with light and stand firm against evil.
- But we do not take revenge. God's role is clear: "it is mine to avenge, I will repay" (Romans 12:19).

We provide armor for the clash against evil, but leave God's work to God.

## üß© How We're Structured
- **Core Team**  
  A small group coordinates projects, vets members, and supports the growth of the collective. 

- **The Collective**  
  A network of technology builders - chosen for both technical skill and Biblical conviction. 

- **Partner Organizations**  
  Biblical institutions and organizations that seek to be more effective in kingdom work.

## üí∞ Financial Model
1. We scope projects with partner organizations.
2. Collective members are assigned contractor-style for paid work. 
3. ClashLight receives a margin to help coordinate projects and drive the mission. 

This creates a **flexible, sustainable talent engine** for kingdom-impacting work. 

> We are seeking alternative financial models to maximize our impact for all. Contribute ideas!

## üìç Why GitHub?
Our model maps well on to the GitHub ecosystem and Open Source mindset: 
- We will use repos as individual projects, both public and private. 
- You can contribute to individual projects, or build the community at large. 
- We'll leverage Issues, PRs, and Prayersource to define our path. 

Github is our gathering place as Builders.
