# ClashLight - Collective of Bible Based AI Builders

On September 10, 2025, **Charlie Kirk was assassinated** while creating space for debate and discussion.  

Charlie was a man, imperfect in ways. But he preached God's word. 

His death, and the approving and even celebratory responses that followed, were an awakening for all that know God... even if only from a distance.

**Charlie's assassination reminded us that Evil is real. And it has a strong foothold to advance from.**

## What Does God Expect of Us, As Technology Builders?

God calls on those who know Him to stand against the schemes of the devil (~ Ephesians 6:11). 

- He blesses each of us with unique gifts. 
- He expects us to use our gifts to help all find him. 
- (~ Romans 12:6-8, ~  Ephesians 4:11-13).

As Builders of technology, we are blessed with the gift of leverage. We can scale human effort and impact millions. 

This has always been true of technology, but we must recognize what is happening RIGHT NOW in the world: 

- The advancement of AI has increased our leverage exponentially. 
- AI has also lowered the barrier to building, which mulitplies the number of builders. 

God works in mysterious ways. I believe that AI's advancement in the year leading up to Charlie Kirk's assassination is NOT a coincidence. 

## What is ClashLight?

ClashLight is a collective of Bible Based AI technology builders. 

We build AI technology solutions for Bible believing organizations. We aim to equip them with technology as an armor of God and a weapon against evil in the world. 

- **AI Software Solutions** - We design and deploy AI technology solutions to strengthen their reach and deepen their impact. 

- **Sometimes Simple** - Trivial solutions have massive impact. We seek awareness of any and all problems that AI can solve.  

- **Shared Source** - Within the collective, ALL projects can be repurposed for future projects - this accelerates impact.

The result is the strenghening and scaling of organizations that do God's work in the world. 

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Operating Principles 
- We don't just share God's light ‚Äî we equip others to clash with light and stand firm against evil.
- But we do not take revenge. God's role is clear: "it is mine to avenge, I will repay" (Romans 12:19).

We provide armor to Bible believing organizations that clash with light against evil. But we leave God's work to God. These principles guide us in who to partner with.  

## üß© How We're Structured
- **Core Team**  
  A small group coordinates projects, vets members, and supports the growth of the collective. 

- **The Collective**  
  A network of technology builders - chosen for both technical skill and Biblical conviction. 

- **Partner Organizations**  
  Biblical institutions and organizations that would benefit from our technology solutions. 

## üí∞ Financial Model
1. We scope projects / budgets with partner organizations.
2. Collective members are assigned contractor-style for paid work. 
3. ClashLight receives a margin to help coordinate projects and drive the mission. 

This creates a flexible and sustainable model to impact the world with our technology solutions. 

> We are seeking alternative financial models to maximize our impact for all. Contribute ideas!

## üìç Why GitHub?
Our model maps well on to the GitHub ecosystem and Open Source mindset: 
- We will use repos as individual projects, both public and private. 
- You can contribute to individual projects, or build the community at large. 
- We'll leverage Issues, PRs, and prayer to define our path. 

Github is our gathering place as Builders.
